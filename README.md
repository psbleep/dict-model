# dict-model

Django extension for constructing model-like objects that are not persisted in the database.

Inspired by the [ActiveHash] gem for Ruby on Rails.

## Development

Linting and code formatting from `black`, `flake8` and `isort`.

Type checking provided by `mypy` and the `pytest-mypy` extension.

Run the tests:

```
pytest --mypy
```
